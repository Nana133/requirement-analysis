# What is Requirement Analysis?

This repository is part of the ALX Pro Dev program. It focuses on understanding the process of requirement analysis in building successful software applications.


## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement analysis is a crucial phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Here are three key reasons why it is essential:

1. **Clarity and Understanding**  
   It helps ensure that all stakeholders—including developers, clients, and users—clearly understand what the software is expected to do, reducing confusion and miscommunication.

2. **Reduced Development Costs**  
   Identifying and resolving issues early in the planning phase is far less costly than fixing them later in development or after deployment.

3. **Improved Project Success Rate**  
   Well-defined and analyzed requirements provide a strong foundation for planning, designing, and implementing the software, increasing the likelihood of delivering a successful, high-quality product.
